This role provides an easy way to configure the systemd-journald logging
service.

## Requirements

See below

### Collection requirements

If you want to manage `rpm-ostree` systems with this role, you will need to
install additional collections.  Please run the following command line to
install them:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -vv -r meta/collection-requirements.yml
```

## Role Variables

The role allows system administrator to configure basic systemd-journald
settings, through the following set of variables which form the role's public
API.

- `journald_persistent` - boolean variable which governs where journald stores
  log file. When set to `true` the logs will be stored on disk in
  `/var/log/journal/`. Defaults to `false`, i.e. `volatile` journal storage.

**NOTE**: The following settings apply to both `persistent` and `volatile` modes
unless otherwise indicated.

- `journald_max_disk_size` - integer variable, in megabytes, that governs how
  much disk space can journal files occupy before some of them are deleted. No
  implicit value is configured by the role, hence default sizing calculation
  described in `man 5 journald.conf` applies.

- `journald_max_files` - integer variable that governs how many journal files
  can be kept at maximum while respecting max disk size settings for journal. No
  implicit value is configured by default.

- `journald_max_file_size` - integer variable, in megabytes, describes the
 maximum size of single journal file. No implicit configuration is set up by the
 role.

- `journald_per_user` - boolean variable, allows to configure whether journald
  should keep log data separate for each user, e.g. allowing unprivileged users
  to read system log from their own user services. Defaults to `true`. Note that
  per user journal files are available only when `journald_persistent: true`.

- `journald_compression` - boolean variable instructs journald to apply
  compression to journald data objects that are bigger than default 512 bytes.
  Defaults to `true`.

- `journald_sync_interval` - integer variable, in minutes, configures the time
  span after which journald synchronizes the currently used journal file to
  disk. By default role doesn't alter currently used value.  This setting is
  only applicable for `journald_persistent: true`.  You will get a warning if
  set otherwise.

- `journald_forward_to_syslog` - boolean variable, control whether log messages
  received by the journal daemon shall be forwarded to a traditional syslog
  daemon. Defaults to `false`.

- `journald_rate_limit_interval_sec` - integer variable, in seconds, configures the
  time interval within which only `journald_rate_limit_burst` messages are handled.
  See `man 5 journald.conf` for more information.

- `journald_rate_limit_burst` - integer variable, sets the upper limit of messages
  from a service which are handled within the time defined by
  `journald_rate_limit_interval_sec`.
  See `man 5 journald.conf` for more information.
