This role provides an easy way to configure systemd-journald logging service.

## Role Variables

Role allows system administrator to configure basic systemd-journald settings,
through following set of variables which form role's public API.

- `journald_persistent` - boolean variable which governs where journald stores
log file. When set to `true` the logs will be stored on disk in
`/var/log/journal/`. Defaults to `false`, i.e. `volatile` journal storage.

- `journald_max_disk_size` - integer variable, in megabytes, that governs how
much disk space can journal files occupy before some of them are deleted.
No implicit value is configured by the role, hence default sizing calculation
described in `man 5 journald.conf` applies.

- `journald_max_files` - integer variable that governs how many journal files
can be kept at maximum while respecting max disk size settings for journal.
No implicit value is configured by default.

- `journald_max_file_size` - integer variable, in megabytes, describes maximum
size of single journal file. No implicit configuration is set up by the role.

- `journald_per_user` - boolean variable, allows to configure whether journald
should keep log data separate for each user, e.g. allowing unprivileged users
to read system log from their own user services. Defaults to `true`. Note that
per user journal files are available only when `journald_persistent: true`.

- `journald_compression` - boolean variable instructs journald to apply
compression to journald data objects that are bigger then default 512 bytes.
Defaults to `true`.

- `journald_sync_interval` - integer variable, in minutes, configures the
time span after which journald synchronizes currently used journal file to disk.
By default role doesn't alter currently used value.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    journald_persistent: true
    journald_max_disk_size: 2048
    journald_per_user: true
    journald_sync_interval: 1
  roles:
    - linux-system-roles.journald
```
